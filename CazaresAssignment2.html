<h1 class="container">Cheech V. Jimmy Corn</h1>
<h2>Legal Question: </h2>
<body> <p>the search and seizure of the marijuana and cocaine conducted by Officer Cheech done lawfully according to the 4th amendment and reasonable clause? </body></p>
<h2>Holding:</h2>
<body> <p>The search and seizure of the marijuana and cocaine were conducted lawfully. The evidence obtained from the search is admissible in court. </body></p>
<h2>Reasoning:</h2>
<h3>Part 1:</h3>
	<body><p>1: privacy doctrine
Was the government action a 4th amend. Search and seizure?
Does the defendant have an actual (subjective) expectation of privacy?
	and
Objective expectation of privacy (Is the expectation of privacy one that society (objective) is prepared to recognize as reasonable)
If yes, was it unreasonable?
If yes, should the evidence taken/seized be excluded (inadmissible) from the criminal proceedings?</body></p>
<h3>Part 2:</h3>
<body><p>To be able to determine if the case was a 4th amendment search or seizure we have to check it through the privacy doctrine. The privacy doctrine asks if the defendant has a subjective expectation of privacy. The subjective expectation of privacy is if the defendant believes if their actions were in fact private. After having determined the defendant's subjective expectation of privacy (as all defendants in cases will have subjective point of views) it asks for the objective expectation of privacy, which is everyone else's point of view on the defendant's expectation of privacy and if it could be recognized as reasonable. If the answer is no to either of these questions we completely stop the test and the defendant loses, if it is yes then we continue onto the next question. The next question asks, was the defendant’s subjective expectation of privacy reasonable? If you answer yes to question 2, then the search and seizure is unreasonable and you move onto question #3. If you answer no to question #2 then the search and seizure is reasonable and the test stops here. In these cases, the defendant loses.  And if so should the evidence that has been taken or seized be excluded or inadmissible from any of the criminal proceedings? </body></p>
<h3>Part 3:</h3>
 <body><p>It has been determined that the government action by Officer Cheech was a fourth amendment search and seizure as Cheech had reasonable suspicion to initiate the traffic stop based on Corn's driving behavior as he had been crossing the double yellow line, which was initially a traffic violation. The privacy doctrine asks if Jimmy Corn had a subjective expectation of privacy. Jimmy corn believed that he did have a subjective expectation of privacy as he was committing a crime, there were no weapons or drugs in plain view, and both the marijuana and cocaine were not on his person but in the privacy of his vehicle. Although, The Objective expectation of privacy placed against him was that Officer Cheech had observed signs of intoxication, such as bloodshot eyes, impaired motor coordination, slight odor of alcohol and overly giggly behavior which had then been followed by Jimmy Corn failing to pass a sobriety test. Jimmy Corn also lied to Officer Cheech when asked if he was under the influence of alcohol or narcotics as he responded “no”. These all provided probable cause to suspect Corn was under the influence of drugs. Therefore, Officer Cheech's search and seizure regarding alcohol and narcotic use was within the ranges of a proper investigation and the defendant Jimmy Corn did not have a reasonable subjective expectation of privacy. Although Jimmy Corn did deny having used alcohol or narcotics his denial to that did not invalidate the officer's reasonable suspicion from his observations. Following Corn's arrest, is when Officer Cheech had done a search of the passenger compartment. The discovery of the marijuana under the front seat was an inevitable and valid result of a search incident to arrest. Additionally, the search of the trunk, which is where the cocaine was found, was justified under the automobile exception. The officer had reasonable belief that contraband or evidence of a crime could be found in the vehicle. For that reason in this case, the defendant loses. Therefore, the search and seizure of the drugs were lawfully conducted. The court confirms the conviction of Jimmy Corn for driving under the influence, possession of marijuana, and possession of cocaine. The search and seizure of the drugs were lawfully conducted by Officer Cheech and the evidence obtained from the search is admissible, therefore the evidence can not be dismissed from court.</body></p>
