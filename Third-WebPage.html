<h3>Part 1:</h3> <h4>4th Amend. Test Outline EX:</h4>
<body><p>1: Privacy Doctrine
Was the government action a 4th amend. Search and seizure?
Does the defendant have an actual (subjective) expectation of privacy?
	and
Objective expectation of privacy (Is the expectation of privacy one that society (objective) is prepared to recognize as reasonable)
If yes, was it unreasonable?
If yes, should the evidence taken/seized be excluded (inadmissible) from the criminal proceedings?</body></p>

<h3>Part 2: </h3> <h4>Outline in written form</h4>
<body><p>To be able to determine if the case was a 4th amendment search or seizure we have to check it through the privacy doctrine. The privacy doctrine asks if the defendant has a subjective expectation of privacy. The subjective expectation of privacy is if the defendant believes if their actions were in fact private. After having determined the defendant's subjective expectation of privacy (as all defendants in cases will have subjective point of views) it asks for the objective expectation of privacy, which is everyone else's point of view on the defendant's expectation of privacy and if it could be recognized as reasonable. If the answer is no to either of these questions we completely stop the test and the defendant loses, if it is yes then we continue onto the next question. The next question asks, was the defendant’s subjective expectation of privacy reasonable? If you answer yes to question 2, then the search and seizure is unreasonable and you move onto question #3. If you answer no to question #2 then the search and seizure is reasonable and the test stops here. In these cases, the defendant loses.  And if so should the evidence that has been taken or seized be excluded or inadmissible from any of the criminal proceedings? </body></p>

<h3>Part 3: </h3>

The objective expectation of privacy states that 1: , 2:, 3: , Was the defendant’s expectation of privacy reasonable? ___ In this case, the defendant __.
