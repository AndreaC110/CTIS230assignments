<h2>Legal question: </h2>
<body><p>Did the police officer violate the 4th amendment and privacy doctrine when he turned over John Snow’s phone and saw his personal messages which was the main lead to his arrest for vehicular homicide?</body></p>
<h2>Holding: </h2>
<body><p>The police officer did in fact violate the 4th amendment and privacy doctrine when he saw John Snow’s personal messages and used it as a lead to his arrest for vehicular homicide.</body></p>
<h2>Reasoning:  </h2>
<body><p>When reviewing the case we found that the defendant, John Snow, did in fact have a subjective expectation of privacy and society is deeming it reasonable. Every defendant is stated to have their own expectation of privacy. When arresting John Snow for vehicular homicide because of the death of a passenger with head trauma, all evidence obtained must be obtained legally to be used against Mr.Snow in court and following all rules in the privacy doctrine, trespass doctrine and 4th amendment. We have reviewed the facts given by both. 
To be able to determine if the case was a 4th amendment search or seizure we have to check it through the privacy doctrine. The privacy doctrine asks if the defendant has a subjective expectation of privacy. The subjective expectation of privacy is if the defendant believes if their actions were in fact private. After having determined the defendant's subjective expectation of privacy (as all defendants in cases will have subjective point of views) it asks for the objective expectation of privacy, which is everyone else's point of view on the defendant's expectation of privacy and if it could be recognized as reasonable. If the answer is no to either of these questions we completely stop the test and the defendant loses, if it is yes then we continue onto the next question. The next question asks, was the defendant’s subjective expectation of privacy reasonable? If you answer yes to question 2, then the search and seizure is unreasonable and you move onto question #3. If you answer no to question #2 then the search and seizure is reasonable and the test stops here. In these cases, the defendant loses.  And if so should the evidence that has been taken or seized be excluded or inadmissible from any of the criminal proceedings. 
While reviewing to see if the case was a 4th amendment search or seizure we checked it through the privacy doctrine. The privacy doctrine asks if the defendant has a subjective expectation of privacy. The subjective expectation of privacy is if the defendant believes if their actions were in fact private. The defendant ,John Snow, believes they were in private because the phone found was indeed his personal phone, the messages found were private between himself and another person, the phone was facing down at the time of the scene, the light on the phone was dimmed and the font used in the phone was very small, the phone was inside his own vehicle, the phone was malfunctioning after the crash which caused it to stay open on the messages and there was no warrant placed allowing the officer to look through Mr.Snow’s, revoking his access to look through any personal item of Mr.Snow’s. After having determined the defendant's subjective expectation of privacy (as all defendants in cases will have subjective point of views) it asks for the objective expectation of privacy, which is everyone else's point of view on the defendant's expectation of privacy and if it could be recognized as reasonable. John Snow was arrested with no firm evidence of timestamp of when the messages were sent that day of the incident. The objective expectation of privacy states that the police officer was in no intent of searching Mr.Snow’s phone as he was only going to hand it to him while Mr.Snow was headed to the hospital with a broken hand, when finding the phone it was frozen and unlocked on messages while the crime had occurred, Mr.Snow had committed several crimes when being found and the officer never forcefully opened or unlocked John’s phone, the weather was perfect for good driving leaving no other explanation. Although, we have reviewed the case and the public deems the defendant, Mr.John Snow’s, expectation of privacy reasonable. John Snow during the time was hurt and being checked on and was never asked to view his personal item such as his phone, the phone was faced down when found at the scene, the weather outside was very sunny causing the officer to readjust John’s phone trying to get a better look into Mr.John’s messages, he also had dimmed light on his screen and had cracks making everything very illegible, therefore the officer had made much more of an intent to look into Mr.John’s phone. To have found the information obtained against Mr.Snow the officer had to put an extreme effort to look through his personal phone going against the privacy doctrine, trespass doctrine and 4th amendment. In this case, the defendant wins. Therefore the evidence that has been taken or seized must be excluded or inadmissible from any of the criminal proceedings. In this case, evidence found in Mr.Snow’s phone by the police officer during the time of the accident must be excluded from this case.</body></p>
